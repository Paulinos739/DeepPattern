# DeepPattern

## Introducing Convolutional Neural Networks for Architectural Pattern Recognition

Independent Research Project @TU Darmstadt

Abstract

The promising methodology  deriving from Christopher Alexanders design-concept of Pattern Languages needs to be revisited and approached on a more holistic level. This paper proposes to leverage the potential of Big Data and Machine Vision to analyticity categorize and retrieve patterns in architectural floor plans.
The research uses Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect design patterns across varying typologies, centuries and styles. The title DeepPattern implies the connection between the programming task of Pattern Recognition with Deep Learning and the theory of Pattern Languages. The method proposed by Alexander et al is directly applied to the task of extracting data in architecture with digital methods, for which I propose the term Architectural Pattern Recognition.
The conducted experiment proved that the algorithms are capable of understanding basic spatial concepts of architectural design, obtaining results from 80% up to 98% accuracy during training on nine architectural design categories in total, trained only on a small dataset of public buildings.
Finally, this paper also presents a simple tool which visualizes the automated prediction of patterns on floor plans through the trained Machine Vision Bots.


### Retrieving Architectural Patterns with CNN

The framework developed here can be used to automatically classify floor plans acoording to its patterns. Use the tool, put a test-image in and test it out on nine different architectural patterns, which gets then visualized in the way demonstrated below.
